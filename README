dpt-mode
--------

A minor mode that wraps dpt-rp1-py[1].  Allows interacting with Sony's
DPT RP1 tablet from within emacs.

Currently presents files stored in the device in an outline-mode
buffer.  Keybindings help navigate quickly between folders and
download files.  To get started run {M-x dpt-list-documents RET}.

The following bindings are defined.

  {n} - go to next visible folder
  {p} - go to previous visible folder
  {d} - download file at point
  {u} - upload file to device
  {q} - exit
